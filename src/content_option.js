      "This Design of Experiments was conducted to explore the potential benifits of switching from a convential delta to an ogive delta configuration in design build fly. The leading edge of the planform was defined using a curve that is descibed in the first image below. Wing area was held constant between the runs to ensure that the nondimensionalization was consistant. A python wrapper around VORSTAB was modified to create the desired planform according to the equation. The Results of the experiment showed that true ogive configurations did not hit sufficient lift coefficients and also had a worse induced drag parameter when compared to the standard delta configuration. It was determined that the straight leading edge offered by the straight edge of the standard delta offered better performance for low Reynold's number applications and that ogive planforms have more application when dealing with wave drag / high Mach number phenomena.",

    projectTitle: "Control Surface Sizing",
    description:
      "During this project. I was tasked with appropriately sizing the Vertical Stabilizer for an aircraft that we had to develop in less than two weeks. I iterated between two different design points, those being one with one vertical stabilizer, and the other being one with two outboard vertical stabilizers. The choice was made to go with one as it would save structural weight in the final design and we would get the added bonus of having the control surface being blown for additional yaw authority. Once appropriately sized, a basic Vstab was Cadded so that we could run CFD to see where the prop wash was hitting the stabilizer. We analyzed this specific point so that we could see if we would be getting any sort of passive stability from the rudder. We ended up making the Vstab tall enough so that it gave us enough passive stability to complete the mission and the initial design flew successfully. During this I also built a calculator that would take geometric parameters that we wanted for the Vstab and output coordinates that could then be put into the AVL file used to analyze the aircraft.",

    projectTitle: "Vortex Shedding Simulation",
    description:
      "During This project, I ran a transient simulation of flow over a tandem cylinder arrangement. This was done using two different RANS modeling methods. The first being the k-omega turbulence model, and the second being the GEKO turbulence model. The GEKO model is a varation of the k-omega model with the freedom to change certain coefficients used in the equations. This allows for different levels of 'aggressiveness' in the prediction of flow seperation. The interesting thing about steady flow over the cylinders is that they reach a sort of steady state solution in the sense that the oscillation frequency of the vorticies being shed is near constant. This allows for the RMS values of lift coefficient and drag coefficient to be extracted. It also allows for a FFT to be performed on the system to get the characteristic frequency of the vortex shedding oscillations. With this frequency, the Strouhal number can be calculated as described below. These results were then compared with experimental data to analyze what aspects of the simulation could be improved to refine the validity of the results.",

The whole project ended up taking a little over 200 lines of code to accomplish.",

We then selected the parameters that would suit the performance of our aircraft the best and I parametrized them in a Python wrapper that would interface with an analysis software called VORSTAB. I would then collect data on the performance of the aircraft and iterate through different design points that we wanted to hit to see what kind of different results we would get for our aircraft. It was through this analysis as well as CFD that was run later that we chose the optimal design point for our aircraft.",

Geometric Constraintes were implemented to find the portions of the solution space that we could operate in. Geometric constraints came from budget, time, and manufacturing constraints. After the desired solution space was found, an OML of the vehicle was developed to perform a weight and CG buildup for a preliminary configuration. This was then used to see if the Vehicle was plausable and if modifications needed to be made to accomodate the plane to the solution space.",

I designed the gear with the load path in mind, with the goal of distributing the load as much as possible throughout the bottom of the bulkheads in the fuselage. The Mounts to the Landing gear were also a challenge as the mounting points were at a point of curvature and needed to allow space between the mounts and the gear so that we could strengthen the Gear. Afterwards The CAD was finished, the landing gear was manufactured using a 3d printed mold and composite layup around to add bending stiffness to the structure.",

    description:
      "During this project, I used a python script that interfaced with AVL to quickly run through and analyze different configurations for a monoplane tail. The configuration that we were looking at was extremely unconventional and analyzing it was a challenge in and of itself. We needed to keep the stability of the plane within a certain range, but also keep in mind the effects of the large amount of downwash we would be getting from our wing. After correctly sizing the tail and confirming the interface of the tail with other people on the team, I developed the tail and the means of load transference between the tail and the fuselage. After the concepts were laid out I created a fully Parametrized CAD of the tail configuration in a week. This allowed us to change important dimensions that drove the construction of the tail itself such as the offset distance between the leading edge of the VStab and the torsion box. While I was making the tail I had to keep in mind our manufacturing process and also integrate tolerances into the drawings and dimensions so that we accounted for the width of the laser cutting the surfaces and also so we maintained good contact between the pieces during construction.",
